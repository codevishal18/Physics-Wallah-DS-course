Q1. What are the three measures of central tendency?
ANS-> Mean, Mode, Median

Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the
central tendency of a dataset?
The mean is calculated by adding up all the values in a dataset and then dividing the sum by the total number of values. It is often referred to as the average. The mean is sensitive to outliers or extreme values in a dataset and can be influenced by them.
The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in order. If there is an even number of values in the dataset, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean and is often used when there are extreme values in the dataset.
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have multiple modes, or no mode at all if no value appears more than once. The mode is useful when you want to know the most common value in a dataset.
To choose which measure of central tendency to use, you need to consider the distribution of the data and the purpose of the analysis. If the data is normally distributed, the mean and median will be similar, but if there are outliers, the median may be a better measure of central tendency. The mode is useful when you want to know the most common value or when the data is categorical.

Q3. Measure the three measures of central tendency for the given height data:
[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
To calculate the mean, we add up all the values and divide by the total number of values:
(178 + 177 + 176 + 177 + 178.2 + 178 + 175 + 179 + 180 + 175 + 178.9 + 176.2 + 177 + 172.5 + 178 + 176.5) / 16 = 176.925
So the mean height is 176.925.
To calculate the median, we first need to sort the data:
[172.5, 175, 175, 176, 176, 176.2, 176.5, 177, 177, 178, 178, 178, 178.2, 178.9, 179, 180]
There are 16 values in this dataset, so the median is the average of the two middle values, which are 177 and 178:
(177 + 178) / 2 = 177.5
So the median height is 177.5.
To calculate the mode, we need to find the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. In this case, 178 appears three times, which is more than any other value. So the mode height is 178.
Therefore, the mean height is 176.925, the median height is 177.5, and the mode height is 178.

Q4. Find the standard deviation for the given data:
[178,177,176,177,178.2,178,175,179,180,175,178.9,176.2,177,172.5,178,176.5]
To calculate the standard deviation, we first need to find the mean of the dataset:
(178 + 177 + 176 + 177 + 178.2 + 178 + 175 + 179 + 180 + 175 + 178.9 + 176.2 + 177 + 172.5 + 178 + 176.5) / 16 = 176.925
Next, we need to calculate the variance, which measures how much the data varies from the mean. We can do this by subtracting the mean from each value, squaring the result, and then taking the average of the squared differences:
[((178-176.925)^2) + ((177-176.925)^2) + ((176-176.925)^2) + ((177-176.925)^2) + ((178.2-176.925)^2) + ((178-176.925)^2) + ((175-176.925)^2) + ((179-176.925)^2) + ((180-176.925)^2) + ((175-176.925)^2) + ((178.9-176.925)^2) + ((176.2-176.925)^2) + ((177-176.925)^2) + ((172.5-176.925)^2) + ((178-176.925)^2) + ((176.5-176.925)^2)] / 15 ≈ 3.0329
Finally, we can calculate the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance:
sqrt(3.0329) ≈ 1.7429
Therefore, the standard deviation of the given dataset is approximately 1.7429.

Q5. How are measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation used to describe
the spread of a dataset? Provide an example.
Measures of dispersion, such as range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe how much variation or spread there is in a dataset. These measures provide important information about the distribution of the data and help to identify any outliers or unusual values.
The range is the simplest measure of dispersion and is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value in the dataset. While the range can be useful in providing a rough estimate of the spread of the data, it is very sensitive to outliers and can be misleading.
The variance is a more precise measure of dispersion that takes into account how far each data point is from the mean of the dataset. To calculate the variance, we subtract the mean from each data point, square the result, and then average the squared differences. The variance gives an idea of how much the data varies from the mean, but it is not in the same units as the original data, making it difficult to interpret.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is a more commonly used measure of dispersion. The standard deviation measures the average distance of each data point from the mean and is expressed in the same units as the original data. It provides a more meaningful measure of the spread of the data and is less sensitive to outliers than the range.
For example, consider the following dataset of test scores: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95. The range is 25 (95 - 70), the variance is approximately 62.5, and the standard deviation is approximately 7.91. This tells us that the scores are fairly spread out, with a range of 25 points and a standard deviation of almost 8 points. The high standard deviation indicates that there is a relatively large amount of variation in the scores, which could indicate that the test was difficult or that the students had different levels of preparation.

Q6. What is a Venn diagram?
a diagram representing mathematical or logical sets pictorially as circles or closed curves within an enclosing rectangle (the universal set), common elements of the sets being represented by intersections of the circles.

Q7. For the two given sets A = (2,3,4,5,6,7) & B = (0,2,6,8,10). Find:
(i) A intersection B
(ii) A ⋃ B
ANS-> i) (2,6)
ii) (0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10)

Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?
Skewness is a measurement of the distortion of symmetrical distribution or asymmetry in a data set. Skewness is demonstrated on a bell curve when data points are not distributed symmetrically to the left and right sides of the median on a bell curve. If the bell curve is shifted to the left or the right, it is said to be skewed.

Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?
Ans-> median<mean

Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in
statistical analysis?
Covariance and correlation are both measures that describe the relationship between two variables in a dataset.
Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together. It is calculated by taking the average of the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means. If the covariance is positive, then the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. However, the magnitude of the covariance depends on the units of measurement of the variables, so it is difficult to interpret and compare between different datasets.
Correlation, on the other hand, is a standardized measure that describes the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. It is calculated by dividing the covariance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. The resulting correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1, with a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative linear relationship, 0 indicating no relationship, and +1 indicating a perfect positive linear relationship. Correlation coefficients are unitless, which means they are easier to interpret and compare across different datasets.
Both covariance and correlation are used in statistical analysis to measure the relationship between two variables. Covariance is useful for determining whether two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while correlation provides a more standardized measure of the strength and direction of the relationship. Correlation is often used to identify patterns and relationships in datasets, and to test hypotheses about the nature of the relationship between variables. It can also be used to select variables for inclusion in predictive models, as highly correlated variables can cause problems with overfitting.

Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a
dataset.
The formula for calculating the sample mean is:
Sample Mean = (sum of all data points) / (number of data points)
In other words, to find the sample mean, we add up all the values in the dataset and then divide by the total number of values.
For example, suppose we have the following dataset of test scores: 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95. To find the sample mean, we add up all the scores and divide by the total number of scores:
Sample Mean = (70 + 75 + 80 + 85 + 90 + 95) / 6
= 495 / 6
= 82.5
Therefore, the sample mean of the test scores is 82.5. This means that, on average, the students scored an 82.5 on the test.

Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?
ANS-> mean=median=mode

Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?
Covariance and correlation are both measures that describe the relationship between two variables in a dataset.
Covariance measures the degree to which two variables vary together. It is calculated by taking the average of the product of the deviations of each variable from their respective means. If the covariance is positive, then the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.

Covariance is useful for determining whether two variables tend to increase or decrease together, while correlation provides a more standardized measure of the strength and direction of the relationship. Correlation is often used to identify patterns and relationships in datasets, and to test hypotheses about the nature of the relationship between variables. It can also be used to select variables for inclusion in predictive models, as highly correlated variables can cause problems with overfitting.

Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.
Outliers are values in a dataset that are significantly different from the other values, either much larger or much smaller. Outliers can have a significant effect on measures of central tendency and dispersion.
When calculating the mean, outliers can greatly skew the result. For example, consider a dataset of salaries of employees in a company, where most salaries are in the range of $40,000 to $80,000, but there is one executive who earns $500,000 per year. If we calculate the mean salary without removing the outlier, the result would be much higher than what most employees earn, which may not be representative of the typical salary in the company.
Outliers can also affect measures of dispersion, such as the range, variance, and standard deviation. For example, if we have a dataset of exam scores where most students scored between 60 and 80, but there is one student who scored 20, the range would be much wider than if that outlier was not present. Similarly, if we calculate the variance or standard deviation with the outlier included, the result would be much larger than if it was not included, indicating that there is a larger spread of data than there really is.
It is important to identify and handle outliers appropriately, as they can greatly affect the interpretation of statistical analyses. Depending on the circumstances, outliers can be removed, transformed, or analyzed separately. However, it is important to do this carefully and with a clear rationale, as removing or altering data can also introduce bias and affect the validity of the results.
